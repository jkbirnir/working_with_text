Create a vector of pdf file names from the pdf files in your directory
(remember to set the working directory to the directory where you are keeping your files)

```{r}
files <- list.files(pattern = "pdf$")
```


# 3:
Extract the text from the pdf

```{r}
documents <- lapply(files, pdf_text)
```

# 4:

Verify and clean

how many documents were read:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
length(documents)
```

The number of pages in each document
```{r, echo=FALSE}
lapply(documents, length) 
```
To see the documents
```{r, echo=FALSE}
documents
```

# 5: Cleaning


```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidytext)
library(stringr)

tidy_documents <- docframe %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)
```
