# Text analysis

"A token is a meaningful unit of text, most often a word, that we are interested in using for further analysis, and tokenization is the process of splitting text into tokens." (TMR)

"The default tokenizing is for words, but other options include characters, n-grams, sentences, lines, paragraphs, or separation around a regex pattern."(TMR)

remove stop words; that are not useful for an analysis, typically extremely common words such as \"the\", \"of\", \"to\", and so forth in English

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```
